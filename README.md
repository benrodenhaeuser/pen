# pen

`pen` is a vector design tool in the browser that live-syncs a drawing canvas with an SVG markup editor. While `pen` is work in progress, a case study of the development so far is available [here](https://benrodenhaeuser.io/2019/10/01/pen/), and a live demo is available [here](https://pen.benrodenhaeuser.io).
